Module 9 Challenge

## Data modeling

Five CSV files have been provided: </BR>
- The **departments.csv** file contains two columns: the department IDs made of four characters and a text description.
- The **titles.csv** file contains two columns: the title IDs made of five characters and a text description.
- The **salaries.csv** file contains two columns: an integer representing the employee IDs and an integer for the corresponding salaries.
- The **employees.csv** file contains seven columns: an integer for the employee IDs, five characters for the employee's titles, a date for the employee's birth dates, a string for the employee's first names, a string for the employee's last names, a single character for the employee's gender, and a date for the employee's hire dates.
- The **dept_managers.csv** file contains two columns and is used to link the department ID with its manager's ID. The two columns are the 4-character department ID and the integer employee's ID. It is to be noted that a department can have more than one manager, while a manager belongs to a single department.
- The **dept_emp.csv** file contains two columns and is used to link the department ID with the employee's ID. The two columns are the integer employee's ID and the 4-character department ID. An employee can only belong to one department, but a department has multiple employees.

Using QuickDBD, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been sketched to descride the interactions between the tables.

The text description behind the sketch can be found in the data folder (_/data/challenge_9_ERD.txt_).

## Data Engineering
The corresponding schema is exported from QuickDBD and is further modified to add the composite keys for the dept_manager_junction table and the dept_emp_junction table prior to the creation of the database tables in PostgreSQL (see _/EmployeeSQL/challenge_9_ERD_schema.sql_).
The CSV files are imported to the PostgreSQL database via pgAdmin4 in the following order: departments, titles, employees, salaries, dept_manager_junction, and dept_emp_junction.

## Data Analysis
The queries for the analysis can be found at _/EmployeeSQL/challenge_9_ERD_Solutions.sql_
